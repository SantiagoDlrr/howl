  "transcript_text": "Alex:\n    Good morning! This is Alex calling from Quick Tech Solutions. How are you doing today?\n\n    Jamie:\n    Are you seriously asking me that? After everything your company has put me through? I’ve spent hours on hold, been transferred a dozen times, and still have no solution.\n\n    Alex:\n    I'm really sorry to hear that, Jamie. I’d be happy to look into this and try to resolve it right away. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?\n\n    Jamie:\n    What happened is I bought one of your so-called smart dishwashers and it broke after five days. Five. Days. Since then, I’ve been promised a replacement, a refund, a technician—you name it. None of that happened. I’ve been lied to, ignored, and completely disrespected as a customer.\n\n    Alex:\n    That’s absolutely not the experience we want our customers to have. Let me check your file and—\n\n    Jamie:\n    Don’t even bother reading off the same script everyone else has. I’ve heard it all. We're escalating it. We'll get back to you. Thank you for your patience. It’s insulting at this point. Just admit you sold me a broken product and don’t want to fix it.\n\n    Alex:\n    I understand you're upset, and you have every right to be. What you’ve experienced is unacceptable. I’ll personally make sure this gets handled today.\n\n    Jamie:\n    You said that last week. And the week before. Every time someone says they’re taking care of it, nothing happens. I’m done playing nice. If I don’t get a refund within 48 hours, I’m filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, disputing the charge with my bank, and leaving a detailed review everywhere I can.\n\n    Alex:\n    That’s completely understandable. Let me at least get the process moving again while we're on the call. I’ll also put in a high-priority note so your case gets addressed within the hour.\n\n    Jamie:\n    I’ll believe it when I see it. So far, all I’ve gotten from Quick Tech Solutions is broken promises and endless apologies that mean nothing.\n\n    Alex:\n    You shouldn’t have to go through that. I’m genuinely sorry. I’ll stay on top of this until you receive confirmation. You have my word.\n\n    Jamie:\n    Your word doesn’t mean anything to me unless I see results. I’ve wasted enough time on this disaster.\n\n    Alex:\n    Understood. You’ll hear back from me directly before the end of the day with a resolution.\n\n    Jamie:\n    Good. You’d better follow through this time.\n\n    Alex:\n    Thank you for your time, Jamie. I really do appreciate your patience.\n\n    Jamie:\n    I’m not being patient. I’m being very clear. Fix it.\n\n    Alex:\n    Got it. You’ll hear from me soon.\n\n    Jamie:\n    You’d better. Goodbye.\n    ",
